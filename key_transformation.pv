(* Key Transformation Protocol Verification in ProVerif *)
(* Channels *)
free c: channel.

(* Types *)
type key.
type nonce.

(* Cryptographic primitives *)
(* Secret key K that should remain confidential *)
free K: key [private].

(* Transformation function F *)
fun F(key): key.
(* We model F as one-way; there is no inverse function *)

(* Additional cryptographic operations *)
fun senc(bitstring, key): bitstring.  (* Symmetric encryption *)
reduc forall m: bitstring, k: key; sdec(senc(m, k), k) = m.  (* Symmetric decryption *)

fun concat(bitstring, bitstring): bitstring.  (* Concatenation operation *)
reduc forall x: bitstring, y: bitstring; fst(concat(x, y)) = x.  (* Extract first component *)
reduc forall x: bitstring, y: bitstring; snd(concat(x, y)) = y.  (* Extract second component *)

fun hash(bitstring): bitstring.  (* Hash function *)

(* This function models a derived key from the transformed key K' *)
fun deriveKey(key): key.

(* Events to track protocol execution *)
event AliceTransformsKey(key, key).
event BobReceivesTransformedKey(key).
event SecureCommsEstablished(key).

(* Security queries *)
(* The main security property: the attacker should not be able to obtain the original key K *)
query attacker(K).

(* Query to verify authentication properties *)
query k1: key, k2: key; event(AliceTransformsKey(k1, k2)) ==> event(BobReceivesTransformedKey(k2)).

(* Verify the session key derived from K' remains secure *)
query k: key; event(SecureCommsEstablished(k)) ==> not attacker(k).

(* Protocol processes *)

    (* She applies transformation F to get K' *)
    let K_prime = F(K) in
    (* Log the transformation event *)
